# Gift Department Student Worker
I worked at the UCSB Campus Store from July 2021 to December 2022 in the Gifts Department. I provided customers with assistance while restocking products on sales floor. I also identified well/low selling products and used these observations to rearrange displays on sales floor to increase foot traffic and sales for all products.

# UEA Events Chair
I joined the Undergraduate Economics Association (UEA) during my second year as part of the Events Committee and began serving as the Events Chair the following year (2022-2024). As the Events Chair, I planned academic and career events given a $500 budget per quarter catered to students with an interest in economics, creating networking opportunities, and highlighting relevant resources for them at UCSB. I coordinated communications with undergraduates, graduates, professors, and alumni who could provide members with insight into building their future as UEA’s liaison in UCSB’s Business Undergraduate Society. This past school year, I created and lead the Events Committee to increase events held throughout a quarter from three to six and boost member involvement.

# Bren-Environmental Studies Fellow
During my third year at UCSB I was selected to be part of the Bren-Environmental Studies Fellowship (BESF) (2022-2024). I was been able to explore different career and academic paths through this program through the connections provided to Fellows with Bren students, faculty, and alumni working in the environmental field. I collaborated with my cohort as the Projects Committee’s Team Coordinator to execute community projects such as creek clean-ups by arranging transportation and team duties. The program also gave me the opportunity to engage in mentoring first-year fellows alongside the program director to ensure fellows’ career interests were being met.

During my fourth year I started working with Dr. Samantha Stevenson.
