I worked at the UCSB Campus Store for a year and a half in the Gifts Department.

I joined the Undergraduate Economics Association during my second year as part of the Events Committee. I began serving as the Events Chair the following year.

I began a fellowship during my third year at the Bren School of Environmental Management.

During my fourth year I started working with Dr. Samantha Stevenson.
