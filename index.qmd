## About me

I’m a fourth year, Economics and Environmental Studies double major at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I will be graduating in 10 days! In addition to serving as the Undergraduate Economics Association’s (UEA) Events Chair, I am a second-year Fellow in the Bren-Environmental Studies Fellowship (BESF). I also work in Dr. Samantha Stevenson’s Climate DataLab as an undergraduate researcher.
