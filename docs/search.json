    "text": "I started running when I joined cross country and track in high school. I stopped running once COVID-19 hit in 2020, but when I moved to Isla Vista in the summer of 2021 I wanted to begin running again as a way to spend more time outside. I was a very inconsistent runner during my second year, but after having a tough time dealing with stressing my during this first year living away from my family, I set a target goal to run at least twice a week starting the summer of 2022. I kept this target most weeks of my third year, but in an effort to viewing running as a fun break from school and not a chore, I allowed myself leniency on going on meeting this target goal if it added stress to my life in order to fit them in my schedule.\nThese past two years, running has been a very useful tool for me to manage stress and anxiety by allowing me to take a breather from school work that did not involve staring at a screen. During my last year at UCSB, I wanted to add a third run to my week in order to begin preparing to run races again. While running three times a week does not seem like a daunting task, it was often difficult to decide what days and times I could go running depending on my workload for the day, the weather, and the daylight available. I especially wanted to add more runs to my week in order to take advantage of being able to run at Coal Oil Point while I still lived in IV. It is my favorite running route."
