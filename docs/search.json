    "text": "Why I run\nI started running when I joined cross country and track in high school. I stopped running once COVID-19 hit in 2020. When I moved to Isla Vista (IV) in the summer of 2021 I wanted to begin running again to spend more time outside. I was a very inconsistent runner during my second year, but after having a tough time dealing with stress during this first year living away from my family, I set a target goal to run at least twice a week starting the summer of 2022. I kept this target most weeks of my third year, but in an effort to keep running as a fun break from school and not a chore, I allowed myself leniency on meeting this goal if trying to fit a run into my day added to my stress.\nThese past two years, running has helped me manage stress and anxiety. It has become my way to take a breather from school. During my last year at UCSB, I wanted to add a third run to my week and train for races. While running three times a week does not seem like a daunting task, it was often difficult to decide what days and times I could go running depending on my workload for the day, the weather, and the daylight available. I especially wanted to add more runs to my week in order to take advantage of being able to run at Coal Oil Point while I still lived in IV. Running to Coal Oil Point from my apartment is my favorite running route and I will miss running there to catch the sunset at Sands Beach when I leave IV.\nI take pictures and/or videos on each of my runs so that I could look back at them and the views I was able to take in later on. The photos in the gallery below are some of my favorites!"

    "text": "Gift Department Student Worker\nI worked at the UCSB Campus Store from July 2021 to December 2022 in the Gifts Department. I provided customers with assistance while restocking products on sales floor. I also identified well/low selling products and used these observations to rearrange displays on sales floor to increase foot traffic and sales for all products. During busy hours, I worked across multiple departments such as Supplies, Clothing, and Textbooks, assisting customers and maintaining store organization.\n\n\nUEA Events Chair\nI joined the Undergraduate Economics Association (UEA) during my second year as part of the Events Committee and began serving as the Events Chair the following year (2022-2024). As the Events Chair, I planned academic and career events given a $500 budget per quarter catered to students with an interest in economics, creating networking opportunities, and highlighting relevant resources for them at UCSB. I coordinated communications with undergraduates, graduates, professors, and alumni who could provide members with insight into building their future as UEA’s liaison in UCSB’s Business Undergraduate Society. This past school year, I created and lead the Events Committee to increase events held throughout a quarter from three to six and boost member involvement.\n\n\nBren-Environmental Studies Fellow\nDuring my third year at UCSB I was selected to be part of the Bren-Environmental Studies Fellowship (BESF) (2022-2024). I was been able to explore different career and academic paths through this program through the connections provided to Fellows with Bren students, faculty, and alumni working in the environmental field. I collaborated with my cohort as the Projects Committee’s Team Coordinator to execute community projects such as creek clean-ups by arranging transportation and team duties. The program also gave me the opportunity to engage in mentoring first-year fellows alongside the program director to ensure fellows’ career interests were being met.\nHere is the link to my page on the BESF’s webpage: BESF\n\n\nClimate DataLab\nDuring my fourth year I started working with Dr. Samantha Stevenson to develop a learning resource website for climate models (2023-2024). I did not know much about climate model and how they are used when I started so I investigated different climate model learning resources with the goal of developing a learning module to facilitate the application of climate models to a variety of projects. Not having prior experience using climate models enabled me to identify areas of confusion when utilizing climate model data such as selecting a model, which differ in how they project natural variability, feedbacks, and forcing, depending on the research questions to ensure the accuracy of the resulting analysis. I developed example Python scripts demonstrating effective methods to handling climate data in CSV and netCDF format, for instance, dealing with date/time format discrepancies between a data file and a library being used to plot a time series of air surface temperature.\nHere is the website with climate model learning resources: Climate DataLab\n\n\n\nDr. Samantha Stevenson’s Group Members"
